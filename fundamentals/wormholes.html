            <h3>Birth</h3>
            <p>
                A black hole from a different dimension becomes so dense that it becomes a wormhole. Next, the
                unbalanced flow of energy creates unstable functionality because of the sudden “pressure” difference. In
                other words, the wormhole needs to have a steady flow of energy. There are several routes that could be
                taken:
            <ol>
                <li>As this energy settles, the wormhole is compacted tightly to fit in this dimension. That forms the
                    starcrystal. All excess matter from the changed wormhole is transformed into gases. From this
                    process, the starcrystal is formed, and it is powered by the fuel that makes up the star.</li>
                <li>The energy does not settle and remains unstable, leading to an early death.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Main</h3>
            <p>
                The starcrystal uses fuel from the gases of the star to keep the black hole stable. This allows the
                black hole to continue to transport energies into this dimension.
            </p>
            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>
                When the starcrystal uses up all of the energy contained in the star, its stability rate lessens
                depending on the energies it contains. Once it is completely unstable, the core collapses in a massive
                gravitational wave in all the universes it connects, leaving a dormant object. This object is called a
                darkcrystal. The size of the darkcrystal ranges from 400-5000yds in diameter.
